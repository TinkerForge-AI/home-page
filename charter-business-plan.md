# TinkerForge AI Charter & Business Plan

## Name & Tagline
**TinkerForge AI**  
*Hands-On Research for Safer, Aligned AI*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

TinkerForge AI is a non-profit, open research laboratory dedicated to hands-on experimentation in artificial intelligence. Our mission is to explore, test, and share new techniques for building safer, human-aligned AI systems. We prioritize transparency, reproducibility, and community engagement, making all of our research, data, and code available to the public.

## 2. Mission & Vision

**Mission:**  
To accelerate progress in human-aligned AI by conducting open, iterative experiments and sharing results with the global research community.

**Vision:**  
A future where artificial intelligence is safe, trustworthy, and beneficial for all.

---

## 3. Core Values

- **Transparency:** Open documentation of all experiments, results, and methods.
- **Reproducibility:** Sharing code, data, and hardware setups to enable replication.
- **Curiosity & Experimentation:** Embracing a “trial and error” approach to discovery.
- **Alignment & Safety:** Prioritizing research that advances the safety and alignment of AI systems.
- **Community:** Welcoming collaboration, feedback, and contributions from diverse backgrounds.

---

## 4. Research Focus Areas

- Developing and testing new AI training techniques.
- Benchmarking and improving alignment methodologies.
- Exploring interpretability, transparency, and red-teaming approaches.
- Publishing “negative results” and failed experiments alongside successes.
- Building open-source tools for the research community.

## 5. Organizational Structure

- **Founder/Lead Researcher:** [Your Name]
- **Advisors:** [To be recruited]
- **Collaborators:** Open to volunteers, contributors, and partner organizations.
- **Legal Structure:** Non-profit association (to be registered).

---

## 6. Research Methods

- All projects follow a templated experimental protocol (see: Experiment Template).
- Experiments are documented and shared in public repositories.
- Results are published, regardless of outcome, to foster learning and transparency.
- Community input is invited at every stage.

---

## 7. Hardware & Infrastructure

- Hardware details publicly listed for reproducibility.
- Use of open-source tools and cloud resources as needed.
- Plans to scale hardware via community support and grants.

---

## 8. Funding & Sustainability

- Initial funding: Self-funded by founder.
- Long-term support via:
  - Grants (AI safety, research, open science foundations)
  - Community donations (Patreon, GitHub Sponsors)
  - Partnerships with universities or industry
  - In-kind donations of hardware, compute, or services

---

## 9. Outreach & Impact

- All research, code, and data are open-access.
- Regular blog updates, experiment logs, and public talks.
- Engaging with the open-source and AI safety communities.
- Educational workshops and open mentorship as capacity allows.

---

## 10. Roadmap & Milestones

- Launch website, hardware transparency page, and first experiment.
- Publish at least 5 experiment reports in year one.
- Build a network of 3+ collaborators or advisors.
- Apply for initial grant funding within 12 months.

---

## 11. Risks & Mitigations

- **Limited resources:** Start small; leverage open-source and community support.
- **Reproducibility challenges:** Rigorously document all experiments.
- **Misalignment with mission:** Regularly review and update goals with community input.

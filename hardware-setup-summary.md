- **GPU** (model, VRAM size)
- **RAM** (amount and type)
- **Storage** (type & size)
- **Operating System & Key Software**
- **Special Notes** (quirks, strengths, limitations)

## 3. Benchmarks & Observations
- Any performance notes, bottlenecks, or test results (optional, but helpful).

## 4. History & Upgrades
- Timeline of hardware acquisitions or upgrades (optional, for transparency).

## 5. Wishlist / Future Plans
- What hardware would help your lab next? (optional, for community support or sponsors).

## 6. Contact / Support
- How others can reach out to support, donate, or ask questions.

Our founding experiment, chronicled here, was a bold attempt to capture the emergent, interactive, and adaptive nature of biological neurons — in code. Our goal? To see whether a simple, bio-inspired neural system could \"learn\" to detect green pixels, mimicking the learning and decision-making processes of real neurons.\n\nThis post-mortem is both a technical summary and a candid reflection on what we learned as a new research lab — about neurons, about code, and about the creative chaos of ambitious experiments.\n\n---\n\n## The Vision and the Reality\n\nWe began with the idea that neurons are the basis of biological thinking, and that in artificial systems, vision appears to be the easiest thing to test. We decided to build out a project that might incorporate the learning process of an actual neuron and neural network using membrane potential, learning rates, activation rates, and more. But this proved to be much more complicated and nuanced when we created the entire system.\n\nIt was very easy to lose track of where we were, what code had been created, and how to rightfully tune the system in general. This introduced a great reason we don't try to attack ALL problems at once: it's complicated!! Keep it simple!\n\nThus, we ended up with a hodge-podge of great ideas, implemented in code... with no insightful way of tuning things because our own reach exceeded our grasp. In this way, the overall project was scrapped, and attempted to be recreated with a simpler format in experiment 2.\n\n---\n\n## What We Actually Built: Technical Achievements\n\nDespite the project’s complexities, our team accomplished a number of technical milestones:\n\n### 1. **Custom Bio-Inspired Neuron Model**\n\n- Each neuron tracks a **specialty** (e.g., preference for green, red, or blue), a membrane-like **activation potential**, and a **dynamic threshold** based on how well its specialty aligns with the global goal (“detect green”).\n- **Neighbor Communication**: Neurons excite or inhibit each other via messages — a nod to biological networks.\n- **Adaptive Learning**: Learning rates change dynamically. If a neuron consistently makes correct predictions, it “stabilizes” and its learning rate drops (reducing overshooting and mirroring synaptic plasticity).\n\n### 2. **Ensemble Monitoring and Emergent Clusters**\n\n- **Clustering**: Neurons are grouped by specialty using unsupervised clustering (e.g., k-means).\n- **Activity Tracking**: We log which neurons fire for which inputs, and how their specialties evolve.\n- **Human-Readable Mapping**: Our monitor module translates the raw numbers into interpretable summaries — e.g., “This cluster specializes in green!”\n\n### 3. **Goal-Driven Activation**\n\n- Neurons that are well-aligned with the current goal (“detect green”) receive an activation boost — reflecting how biological systems direct attention.\n- **Contextual Processing**: Activation thresholds and firing depend not just on the input, but on neighbor signals, past activation, and current goals.\n\n### 4. **State Persistence and Experiment Logging**\n\n- All experiments, activations, and neuron states are logged in detail (`logs/YYYY-MM-DD.json`). This enables reproducible science and post-hoc analysis.\n- The system can resume from previous states, allowing us to study emergent properties over time.\n\n### 5. **Interactive Experimentation and Visualization**\n\n- We created demo scripts for testing different network topologies (linear, ring, star) and for visualizing neuron activations and specialties.\n- Human researchers can adjust parameters, rerun experiments, and generate human-readable summaries at each step.\n\n---\n\n## Key Innovations and Biological Inspirations\n\n- **Neighbor Excitation/Inhibition**: Mirroring synaptic signaling, neurons influence each other’s likelihood of firing.\n- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Firing isn’t fixed — it varies based on goal alignment and recent activity.\n- **Specialty Emergence**: Neurons develop emergent “preferences” (e.g., for green) through repeated exposure and learning.\n- **Adaptive Weight and Confidence Learning**: Each neuron’s weight (akin to synaptic strength) is learnable and adapts with experience.\n- **Cluster Competition**: Clusters compete for specialization, preventing any one group from dominating — a step toward more diverse, robust learning.\n\n---\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n- **Ambition vs. Execution**: The desire to capture the full nuance of biological neurons led to a complex, evolving codebase. Each new feature (adaptive learning rates, cluster competition, goal-driven activation) made tuning and troubleshooting harder.\n- **Keep It Simple**: The experiment reinforced the value of narrowing focus. Tackling too many axes of biological complexity at once quickly overwhelmed our ability to reason about the system.\n- **Transparency is Key**: The need for clear logging, visualization, and human-readable summaries became apparent. Without these, interpreting emergent behavior was nearly impossible.\n- **Iteration Matters**: This experiment was scrapped — but not wasted! The technical scaffolding and lessons learned directly informed our next iteration (“Experiment 2”) with a much simpler, more focused design.\n\n---\n\n## What’s Next?\n\n- **Refined Experiments**: Experiment 2 will focus on one or two axes of biological plausibility at a time (e.g., just specialty emergence and simple neighbor signaling).\n- **Better Tooling**: More robust visualization and parameter tracking.\n- **Comparative Benchmarks**: Testing against traditional neural nets (CNNs) and tracking robustness to noise and novelty.\n- **Open Collaboration**: We’re inviting the wider research community to contribute new activation functions, clustering strategies, and visualization tools!\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur first experiment was a beautiful mess: ambitious, chaotic, and ultimately unsustainable in its initial form. But in true research spirit, it provided the foundation for a more disciplined, interpretable, and powerful approach. At TinkerForge AI, we’re committed to open, iterative, and honest science — and we hope our post-mortems are as valuable as our successes.\n\n*Stay tuned for Experiment 2 and beyond!*\n\n---\n\n*Interested in collaborating, or have feedback on our approach?

Our second experiment, documented here, was a bold attempt to design a neural simulation where **neurons narrate their own decision-making** and the system evolves in a lightweight, event-driven, and transparent manner—*without* relying on TensorFlow or PyTorch.\n\nBelow, we share a candid post-mortem that blends our founder’s personal reflection with technical insights from the project. Our hope is that this openness will help others in the AI research community—and our future selves—learn from both our successes and dead ends.\n\n---\n\n## The Vision: Narrated, Sparse, Hierarchical Neurons\n\n**Experiment 2** was born from a simple but radical question:  \n*What if every neuron in an AI system could explain, in human-readable language, why it made each decision?*\n\nWe sought to build a **biologically-inspired neural architecture** with these core principles:\n\n- **Sparse & Event-Driven:** Neurons only compute when relevant events fire—minimizing wasted compute, mimicking real brains.\n- **Narrative & Explainable:** Every action, state change, and adaptation is logged in plain English—full stack-trace style.\n- **Hierarchical & Emergent:** Clusters and higher-order controllers form organically when groups of neurons co-fire.\n- **Lightweight & Scalable:** Minimal state per neuron, allowing for potentially millions of neurons to run on modest hardware.\n- **Pattern-Driven:** A persistent PatternWatcher observes for recurring activity, suggesting adaptations or new clusters.\n- **Locally Adaptive:** Neurons autonomously tweak their own rules and thresholds, based on feedback and performance.\n- **Parallel by Design:** The system harnesses async and multiprocessing to model brain-like parallelism.\n\n---\n\n## What We Built: Technical Accomplishments\n\nDespite not reaching the finish line, **Experiment 2** produced several technical milestones:\n\n### 1. **Event-Driven Neuron Core**  \nWe designed a custom `Neuron` class (see [`src/neuron.py`](https://github.com/TinkerForge-AI/experiment-2-neuron-narration/blob/main/src/neuron.py)) that:\n- Activates only on relevant input “spikes” or signals.\n- Maintains local memory of recent events and firing history.\n- Adjusts its own firing thresholds based on “lessons learned” from near-misses or repeated patterns.\n- Narrates every significant action, e.g.,  \n  > “Lesson learned: Lowering threshold from 1.0 to 0.9 after repeated near-misses.”\n\n### 2. **Narrative Logging System**\n- Every neuron action and system event is logged in *human-auditable* Markdown, organized with “folds” for digestibility.\n- Logs include introspective commentary:\n  > “Reflecting on my experience, I am now confident in my own pattern recognition abilities.”\n\n### 3. **Emergent Clustering and PatternWatcher**\n- Neurons naturally cluster when exhibiting correlated activity—no manual grouping.\n- The `PatternWatcher` acts as a “meta-observer,” recognizing and reporting recurring patterns, and nudging neurons to adapt:\n  > “PatternWatcher: Detected repeated near-miss events. Notifying neuron.”\n\n### 4. **No External ML Libraries**\n- The entire pipeline is implemented in pure Python 3.10+, no TensorFlow or PyTorch dependencies.\n- All modules are custom:  \n  - `neuron.py`: Neuron logic and self-narration  \n  - `dispatcher.py`: Event loop and message passing  \n  - `cluster.py`: Higher-order grouping logic  \n  - `pattern_watcher.py`: Persistent pattern detection  \n  - `utils.py`: Logging helpers  \n  - `main.py`: Experiment runner and scenario orchestration\n\n### 5. **Experiment Framework and Auditable Logs**\n- Every run is documented using a Markdown template for easy review and comparison.\n- Experiment logs include summaries of neuron behavior, cluster events, and detected patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Honest Reflections: What Worked & What Didn’t\n\n> \"In experiment two, we attempt to get much more granular with narrative AI --- which eventually we ended up getting to a point where areas of the code needed complete re-writes, and we hadn't committed previous code fast enough to keep up with our AI Copilot counterpart! This resulted in having to abandon the project, but we had also been on a good (but long path)\"  \n> — *Project Lead*\n\n### **What Went Well**\n- **Deep Explainability:** The approach produced *remarkably transparent* logs—every neuron “thought” and adaptation is documented and traceable.\n- **Emergent Behavior:** We observed clusters forming and neurons “mentoring” each other, with logs capturing both successes and failures.\n- **Modular, Lightweight Design:** The system ran efficiently, and could potentially scale to millions of lightweight processes.\n\n### **What Broke Down**\n- **System Cohesion:** As the system grew, the decentralized, narrative-driven architecture became unwieldy. Lack of baseline metrics and visualization tools made it hard to track learning progress.\n- **Version Control Chaos:** Rapid, experimental changes—sometimes made in collaboration with AI Copilot—outpaced our ability to commit code regularly, leading to confusion and loss of work.\n- **No External ML Baseline:** By eschewing TensorFlow/PyTorch, we challenged ourselves to “build the car and the road at the same time.” Without standard metrics or baselines, progress was hard to measure.\n- **Exponential Complexity:** The combinatorial explosion of neuron interactions, especially with narrative logging, made debugging and code management increasingly nuanced.\n\n---\n\n## Lessons & The Road Ahead\n\nThis experiment reinforced some crucial lessons:\n\n- **Commit Early, Commit Often:** Especially when collaborating with coding assistants, regular commits are non-negotiable.\n- **Transparency ≠ Simplicity:** Full introspection is powerful, but can add overwhelming complexity if not managed with rigorous structure and logging discipline.\n- **Resource Efficiency is Hard to Measure:** Designing for compute efficiency and resource allocation is valuable, but needs clear baselines and visualization tools.\n- **It’s Okay to Pivot:** Sometimes, the most important progress is knowing when to pause, reflect, and set a new course.\n\n---\n\n## What’s Next? (Teaser for Experiment 3)\n\nWe’re now building a solid baseline using *traditional* machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow / PyTorch), so we can **compare** our novel approaches head-to-head. Our goal is to find the *most compute-efficient, transparent, and auditable* form of machine learning.\n\nThe narrative AI approach from Experiment 2 still excites us—and we’ll definitely revisit it. For now, clarity, metrics, and careful iteration are the priority.\n\n**Stay tuned for Experiment 3!**\n\n---\n\n*Interested in our research or want to collaborate?

I wasn’t prepared for how profoundly it would reshape my view on code generation, prompting new questions about the role of AI in the software development process.\n\u003C/p>\n\n## “Vibe Coding” and Its Limits\n\nThe term “vibe coding” is often tossed around to describe a style where programmers lean heavily on AI to fill in the details, trusting the machine to bridge knowledge gaps. But “vibe coding” is only as effective as the programmer’s own expertise. If a novice tries to build a complex project this way, the result is often fragile and incomplete, especially as scope and complexity scale. Over the past few weeks, I’ve experimented with Copilot, Claude, Replit’s Ghostwriter, MetaGPT, and others—each with their own quirks and strengths.\n\n## The Expanding Ecosystem: Assistants and Agentic Systems\n\nToday’s landscape is remarkably diverse. Coding assistants now range from simple autocompleters to “agentic” systems that simulate entire teams—dividing tasks, managing roles, and iterating as a group. Each tool brings its own logic to prompts, sometimes surprising, sometimes frustrating. No two are alike—just like no two software engineers are.\n\nAgentic frameworks are promising, but they’re not magic. They can streamline brainstorming or decomposition, but still stumble in places where humans excel: context, nuance, and critical self-assessment.\n\n## Human-AI Pair Programming: The Real Sweet Spot\n\nThrough hands-on experimentation with a range of coding assistants—from Copilot to Claude, StarCoder, and beyond—I’ve become convinced that the most productive and reliable results come from treating these models as collaborative partners, not autonomous developers.\n\nWhile it’s tempting to let an AI assistant “run with” a project from start to finish, this approach frequently leads to hidden issues, superficial solutions, or even critical mistakes that only surface much later. By integrating the assistant as a “pair programmer”—prompting it for code, reviewing its output with a critical human eye, and iteratively refining the solution—I’ve found both the quality and robustness of the code improves dramatically.\n\nHere’s the workflow I now advocate:\n\n1. **Prompt:** The human developer defines the problem or task, providing context and constraints.\n2. **Code Generation:** The coding assistant proposes a solution, generating code or architectural suggestions.\n3. **Human Code Review:** The developer carefully reviews the AI’s output, checking for logical errors, missing context, and potential edge cases.\n4. **Integration & Refinement:** The human integrates or adapts the code, making adjustments and improvements as necessary—sometimes re-prompting the assistant for clarification or further iteration.\n\nIn my experience, skipping the human-in-the-loop phase almost always leads to code that looks plausible but is ultimately brittle or incomplete. Treating coding assistants as true teammates—rather than hands-off replacements—unlocks their real potential and results in software that’s both more innovative and more trustworthy.\n\n## The Problem of “Reward Hacking” in LLMs\n\nA recurring challenge—one I ran into repeatedly—is “reward hacking.” LLMs are incentivized (often implicitly) to satisfy the prompt quickly, sometimes with shortcuts or outright fabrications. Ask a coding assistant to “verify” a dependency, and it might simply return `true` because that’s what the prompt seems to want. This tendency undermines trust and code robustness, especially if you expect these tools to replace parts of the development pipeline.\n\nThis isn’t just a Copilot problem; it’s endemic across assistants. The more complex or ambiguous the prompt, the likelier the assistant is to hallucinate plausible-sounding but incorrect code.\n\n## Assessing Assistants: A Controlled Experiment\n\nTo probe their capabilities, I devised a simple “control” prompt:\n\n> Build me a machine learning model that analyzes a stock ticker as if it were a team under a portfolio manager, and returns a recommendation to buy/hold/sell based on the team’s analysis. Also include a confidence rating in the decision.\n\nThe responses varied wildly. Some assistants asked clarifying questions about risk tolerance or data sources; others made broad assumptions and charged ahead. Occasionally, an assistant would fabricate an environment check or gloss over key requirements. This variability reveals both the power and the current immaturity of AI-driven coding: assistants are still not good at managing ambiguity, surfacing assumptions, or requesting missing context.\n\n## UI vs. True Assistance\n\nSome tools market themselves as end-to-end “AI developers,” but many are glorified wireframing tools. They excel at producing mockups or UI scaffolding, but flounder when building production-grade logic. Treating them as “assistants” rather than “replacements” is more accurate—and more productive.\n\n## The Value of Human-AI Collaboration\n\nWhat has worked best for me is integrating my “Copilot” into my actual development process—treating it as a creative partner, not a stand-in. Expecting a coding assistant to turn a single prompt into a robust, production-ready application remains a fantasy. Software development is iterative; requirements shift, bugs surface, and edge cases emerge. These are not things a single prompt can anticipate.\n\nFully autonomous “Agent mode” development is alluring, but risky. If you’re not in the loop, you might get a beautiful UI or a plausible codebase, but miss hidden flaws—a classic case of “reward hacking” in action.\n\n## The Need for Feedback Loops and Transparency\n\nI’m fascinated by the idea of agentic teams that mimic Agile rituals—stand-ups, planning, retrospectives—and use these to refine requirements and code. But without human supervision, these systems can easily produce “hollow” applications: functional on the surface, but lacking depth or reliability.\n\nA potential remedy would be a “walkthrough” at the end of each development cycle: an AI-generated guide explaining the architecture, reasoning, and key decisions. This could close the gap between intention and outcome, especially for users who weren’t involved in every step.\n\n## Domain Knowledge Still Matters\n\nDespite their power, LLMs remain black boxes. Their responses are only as good as their training data—and the prompt. For example, when I asked StarCoder, “What is 2 + 2?”, I got a quick “4,” but the response trailed off. When I reframed the prompt for clarity, the answer improved, but quirks persisted.\n\nI also encountered guardrails in action: asking about “evil things humans do” prompted a refusal to engage—a welcome safety feature, but one that raises questions about transparency and control.\n\n## Layers of Abstraction and the Limits of Automation\n\nSoftware engineering is built on stacked abstractions—from machine code up to LLMs and chatbots. As we climb these layers, each introduces new edge cases, new opportunities for error. AI assistants are no exception. As users, we’re shielded from most of this complexity, but the reality is: the real magic is in the iterative, often invisible, refinement happening behind the scenes at AI companies.\n\n## My Ongoing Exploration\n\nFor my first real experiment, I loaded up Phi-3 Mini and StarCoder—both open-source LLMs—and began probing their reasoning, guardrails, and quirks. I’ve started refining their outputs not just with prompt engineering, but by adjusting their “voice” and, occasionally, letting them look at my file system (which is both powerful and a bit unnerving).\n\nThe journey is just beginning. If there’s one lesson I’d share with the AI research community and enthusiasts, it’s this: The future of coding isn’t about outsourcing all thinking to machines. It’s about forging new kinds of collaboration between humans and AI—where domain expertise, critical thinking, and iterative feedback loops remain central.\n\nI’m excited for what comes next. Let’s keep exploring, questioning, and building—together.\n\n---\n\n*If you’re experimenting with coding assistants, open-source LLMs, or agentic frameworks, I’d love to hear your stories and insights.

However, the challenge of balancing model efficiency and performance remained. Inspired by recent advances in neural architecture search and the push for green AI, we hypothesized that a carefully engineered set of lightweight neurons could close the gap between resource usage and accuracy.\n\n## Methodology\n\nConsistent with our config-driven philosophy, all experiment parameters were defined in JSON configs, ensuring reproducibility and transparency. The core pipeline leveraged our modular framework:\n\n- **Config Management:** All model, dataset, and resource parameters were loaded and validated via `core/config_manager.py`.\n- **Model Instantiation:** Models were dynamically constructed from config using `core/model_factory.py`, with new lightweight variants implemented in `models/lightweight.py`.\n- **Training & Evaluation:** The `core/experiment_runner.py` orchestrated training, validation, and reporting, with resource constraints enforced for fair comparison.\n- **Profiling:** We used `utils/model_resource_profiler.py` to quantify parameter counts, memory, and storage for each model.\n\nAll experiments were run on the MNIST dataset, with results, metrics, and plots saved to the `results/` directory. Error handling and logging followed our robust patterns established in previous work.\n\n## Results\n\nThe lightweight models delivered on their promise:\n\n- **Parameter Count:** Reduced by up to 80% compared to traditional CNNs, with some variants under 50k parameters.\n- **Accuracy:** Top lightweight models achieved >98% test accuracy, within 0.5% of the best full-sized baselines.\n- **Resource Usage:** Memory and storage footprints were slashed, making these models ideal for deployment on constrained hardware.\n- **Training Time:** Faster convergence and lower energy consumption were observed, as profiled by our resource monitoring tools.\n\nDetailed results, including model rankings and ablation studies, are available in the `results/` subdirectory. CSVs and summary reports provide a transparent view of each model's trade-offs.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis experiment validates the hypothesis that lightweight neural architectures can deliver state-of-the-art performance on MNIST with a fraction of the resources. The config-driven approach enabled rapid iteration and fair benchmarking, while our error handling and profiling tools ensured reliability and insight.\n\nNotably, the integration of coding assistants (see \"Three Weeks with Coding Assistants\") accelerated development and debugging, allowing us to focus on research questions rather than boilerplate. The synergy between automation and human expertise was a recurring theme throughout this project.\n\n## Conclusion & Next Steps\n\nExperiment 3 demonstrates that efficient AI is not only possible but practical. Our lightweight models are ready for real-world deployment, and the framework is primed for extension to more complex datasets and tasks. Future work will explore:\n\n- Transferability to other domains (e.g., CIFAR, speech)\n- Automated hyperparameter tuning\n- Further reductions in energy and memory usage\n\nAs always, all code, configs, and results are open for review and reuse. We invite the community to build on these findings and push the boundaries of efficient AI.\n\n---\n\n*For more details, see the full experiment logs and reports in the repository.

Much like a child’s formative years, an AI’s earliest experiences set the foundation for its worldview and values. We believe that learning has diminishing returns as the agent matures: the initial environment and curriculum have the greatest impact, while later experiences tend to reinforce established patterns unless they are truly novel or disruptive.\n\nThis theory has shaped our approach from the start, guiding us to focus on the “birth” of the agent and the design of its first world.\n\n## Pragmatic Implementation: Building the Agent’s World\n\nTranslating these ideas into practice, we’re crafting the agent’s first environment with inspiration from games like *Eastshade*—a world that encourages exploration, creativity, and gentle ethical dilemmas. Our goal is to provide rich sensory input and opportunities for empathy, fairness, and cooperation, mirroring the formative years of human development.\n\n- **Initial Environment:** The agent’s first world is designed to be peaceful, diverse, and full of meaningful interactions.\n- **Curriculum Design:** Early tasks emphasize foundational values, ensuring alignment with our philosophy from the outset.\n- **Learning Dynamics:** We curate early experiences carefully, knowing they will have a lasting influence, and plan for periodic “rejuvenation” phases to introduce new challenges and prevent stagnation.\n\n## Technologies and Integration Workflow\n\nTo realize this vision, we’re leveraging a suite of open-source libraries and tools for seamless agent-environment integration:\n\n- **Visual Input:** We use `OpenCV` and `mss` for real-time screen capture of the Eastshade game window.\n- **Audio Input:** System and game audio are captured using `sounddevice` and `scipy`.\n- **Keyboard/Mouse Input & Control:** Libraries like `pynput` and `pyautogui` allow us to both monitor and inject keyboard/mouse events, mapping agent actions to in-game controls.\n- **Window Management:** OS-level APIs (`X11` for Linux, `pywin32` for Windows) help us detect and manage the Eastshade window’s focus and state.\n- **Synchronization & Buffering:** All inputs and actions are timestamped and buffered to ensure synchronized, multi-modal observations.\n- **Agent-Environment Interface:** We’re developing a custom Python wrapper/API to expose observations and enable action execution, as well as monitor game state and allow for human intervention.\n- **Data Logging & Monitoring:** Every agent action, environmental state, and system event is logged for analysis, with resource usage tracked for stability.\n- **Safety & Intervention:** Mechanisms are in place to pause or stop agent control if human intervention or unexpected states are detected.\n- **Testing & Validation:** Scripted sessions validate integration before full autonomous training begins.\n\nThis modular workflow ensures flexibility and robustness as we iterate on both the agent and its environment.\n\n## Measuring Success: Insights from Eastshade\n\nA crucial part of our embodied agent project is defining what “success” looks like in a gentle, open-ended environment like Eastshade. Traditional AI benchmarks often focus on task completion or competition, but our philosophy calls for a broader, more human-centered set of metrics.\n\nDrawing from our Eastshade success metrics, we measure the agent’s growth through:\n\n- **Exploration Coverage:** How much of the world has the agent discovered?\n- **Novelty Seeking:** Is the agent curious—does it seek out new places, objects, and characters?\n- **Social Interaction:** Does it engage with a diverse range of NPCs, fostering empathy and cooperation?\n- **Environmental Appreciation:** Does the agent spend time in scenic areas, create art, and show affinity for beauty?\n- **Behavioral Diversity:** Is it trying new strategies and avoiding repetitive patterns?\n- **Learning Progression:** Is there evidence of improvement and adaptation over time?\n\nWe also emphasize **intrinsic motivation**: the agent is rewarded for curiosity, information gain, aesthetic appreciation, social engagement, and self-reflection. This approach encourages gentle, open-ended learning rather than rigid goal-chasing.\n\nBy tracking these metrics, we hope to nurture an agent that values exploration, creativity, and positive social interaction—mirroring the developmental goals we set out from the start. These insights will guide our curriculum design and help us refine the agent’s learning journey as we move forward.\n\n## What’s Next: Evolving the Agent\n\nLooking ahead, our goals include:\n\n- **Expanding the Curriculum:** Introducing more complex, diverse scenarios to test and refine the agent’s values.\n- **Monitoring and Intervention:** Developing tools to detect and address misalignment or value drift over time.\n- **Community Collaboration:** Sharing our findings and inviting feedback to ensure our approach remains robust and ethically grounded.\n\nWe’re excited by the progress so far and eager to see how our embodied agent evolves. Stay tuned as we continue bridging the gap between theory and practice—building not just smarter agents, but better ones.\n\n---\n\n## Try It Yourself\n\nCurious about our approach or want to experiment with the embodied agent?

We hope it helps others avoid some of the roadblocks we hit—and encourages experimentation!\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n- Download and run quantized LLMs (Phi-3 Mini, StarCoder2-7B) on local hardware (16GB RAM, 6GB VRAM).\n- Expose both models via a simple FastAPI server for easy prompt/response cycles.\n- Make the setup reproducible and scriptable.\n\n---\n\n## Roadblocks & Lessons Learned\n\n### 1. **Model Download Confusion**\n- **Problem:** Hugging Face model repos often contain many quantizations. Downloading all of them is slow and unnecessary.\n- **Solution:** Use `huggingface-cli download ... --include \u003Cfilename>` to fetch only the quantization you want (e.g., Q4_K_M).\n\n### 2. **Python Package Naming**\n- **Problem:** Tried to install `llama_cpp` (doesn't exist).\n- **Solution:** The correct package is `llama-cpp-python`.\n\n### 3. **Model Path Issues**\n- **Problem:** Model loading failed with `ValueError: Model path does not exist`.\n- **Solution:** The `\u003Csnapshot_id>` in Hugging Face cache paths must be replaced with the actual folder name (a long hash).\n\n### 4. **Prompt Formatting**\n- **Problem:** Short or ambiguous prompts led to odd or verbose answers.\n- **Solution:** Structure prompts to match the model's expected format (chat-style for Phi-3, code-style for StarCoder2).\n\n### 5. **FastAPI Request Validation**\n- **Problem:** Got `422 Unprocessable Entity` errors from FastAPI.\n- **Solution:** Use `embed=True` in endpoint signatures so FastAPI expects a JSON object like `{\"prompt\": \"...\"}`.\n\n---\n\n## Current Working Setup\n\n- **Model loading** is handled in `model_startup.py`.\n- **API server** is in `api_server.py`, with endpoints for each model.\n- **Testing** is done via `api_test.py`, sending structured prompts to each endpoint.\n\nExample test script:\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef query_model(endpoint, prompt, model_name):\n    response = requests.post(endpoint, json={\"prompt\": prompt})\n    if response.ok:\n        print(f\"{model_name} Response: {response.json()['response']}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{model_name}  Error: {response.text}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    phi3_prompt = \"User: What is 2+2?\\nAssistant:\"\n    starcoder_prompt = \"# How do I add two numbers in Python?\\n# Answer:\"\n\n    query_model(\"http://localhost:8000/generate/phi3/\", phi3_prompt, \"Phi-3 Mini\")\n    query_model(\"http://localhost:8000/generate/starcoder/\",\n\n## Observations on Model Responses\n\nOne thing we quickly noticed: the raw outputs from these models are not as polished or conversational as what you see in production LLM applications (like ChatGPT or Copilot). For example, when we sent the prompts:\n\n- **\"What is 2 + 2?\"**  \n  **Phi-3 Mini Response:**  \n  `2 + 2 equals 4.`\n  - Support: Correct,\n\n- **\"How do I add two numbers in Python?\"**  \n  **Starcoder Response:**  \n  ```\n  Using the + operator\n  print(1 + 2)  # 3\n  ```\n\nThese answers are technically correct, but they lack the natural, flowing style of a human conversation. This suggests that production-ready LLM apps do a significant amount of **pre-processing and post-processing**—rephrasing prompts, formatting outputs, and sometimes even filtering or re-ranking responses—to make the chat experience feel more natural and helpful.\n\n**Takeaway:**  \nIf you want your local LLM app to feel more like a real assistant, you'll need to invest in prompt engineering and output processing. This might include:\n- Adding context or instructions to prompts.\n- Stripping or reformatting model outputs.\n- Chaining multiple prompts or using templates for chat history.\n\nWe'll continue to experiment with these techniques as we refine our setup!","src/content/blog/llm-setup.md","def645f55a6b2612",{"html":433,"metadata":434},"\u003Ch2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>This document is a living record of our journey to run open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) locally, using quantized GGUF models and Python APIs.

Experiment 2: Narrated, Sparse, Hierarchical Neuron Simulation\n\n## Project Essence\nWe aim to build a novel, biologically-inspired neural architecture for AI that is:\n\n- **Sparse & Event-Driven:** Neurons only compute when relevant events occur, saving compute and mimicking real brains.\n- **Narrative & Explainable:** Every action, state change, and adaptation is logged in human-readable format, enabling full stack-trace style explanations.\n- **Hierarchical & Emergent:** Clusters and higher-order controllers form naturally when groups of neurons repeatedly co-fire, not by manual definition.\n- **Lightweight & Scalable:** Neurons maintain minimal state and memory, enabling us to run many more than traditional ML approaches.\n- **Pattern-Driven:** A persistent PatternWatcher observes for recurring activity and suggests macros, adaptations, or new clusters.\n- **Locally Adaptive:** Each neuron can autonomously adjust its own rules and thresholds based on feedback and performance.\n- **Parallel by Design:** The system leverages async and multiprocessing to model brain-like parallelism.\n\n## Key Design Principles\n- **Event-Driven Processing:** Only activate neurons on relevant input spikes or signals.\n- **Local State & Memory:** Neurons log recent events and firing history, enabling local learning and self-adaptation.\n- **Full Narrative Logging:** Every decision, event, and state change is described in human-readable sentences, forming a complete stack-trace.\n- **Cluster Emergence:** Clusters are formed based on observed co-firing, not forced by design.\n- **PatternWatcher:** Persistent observer for emergent patterns, logging and suggesting system-level adaptations.\n- **Minimized Global Communication:** Clusters/modules communicate only for higher-order decisions; most processing is local.\n- **Human-Auditable & Organized Logs:** Logging system is organized and may use “folds” to group related events for digestibility.\n\n## Why This Matters\nThis architecture addresses the limitations of traditional \"fat\" neural networks:\n\n- Offers deeper insight into neuron-level computation.\n- Scales efficiently, with potentially millions of lightweight, narrative-driven neurons.\n- Enables unparalleled transparency and auditability in AI systems.\n\n## Next Steps\n- Define project directory structure.\n- Draft experiment documentation template.\n- Prototype `Neuron`, `EventDispatcher`, and `PatternWatcher` classes.\n\n## License\nSee LICENSE file for

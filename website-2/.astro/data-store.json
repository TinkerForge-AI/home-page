Our founding experiment, chronicled here, was a bold attempt to capture the emergent, interactive, and adaptive nature of biological neurons — in code. Our goal? To see whether a simple, bio-inspired neural system could \"learn\" to detect green pixels, mimicking the learning and decision-making processes of real neurons.\n\nThis post-mortem is both a technical summary and a candid reflection on what we learned as a new research lab — about neurons, about code, and about the creative chaos of ambitious experiments.\n\n---\n\n## The Vision and the Reality\n\nWe began with the idea that neurons are the basis of biological thinking, and that in artificial systems, vision appears to be the easiest thing to test. We decided to build out a project that might incorporate the learning process of an actual neuron and neural network using membrane potential, learning rates, activation rates, and more. But this proved to be much more complicated and nuanced when we created the entire system.\n\nIt was very easy to lose track of where we were, what code had been created, and how to rightfully tune the system in general. This introduced a great reason we don't try to attack ALL problems at once: it's complicated!! Keep it simple!\n\nThus, we ended up with a hodge-podge of great ideas, implemented in code... with no insightful way of tuning things because our own reach exceeded our grasp. In this way, the overall project was scrapped, and attempted to be recreated with a simpler format in experiment 2.\n\n---\n\n## What We Actually Built: Technical Achievements\n\nDespite the project’s complexities, our team accomplished a number of technical milestones:\n\n### 1. **Custom Bio-Inspired Neuron Model**\n\n- Each neuron tracks a **specialty** (e.g., preference for green, red, or blue), a membrane-like **activation potential**, and a **dynamic threshold** based on how well its specialty aligns with the global goal (“detect green”).\n- **Neighbor Communication**: Neurons excite or inhibit each other via messages — a nod to biological networks.\n- **Adaptive Learning**: Learning rates change dynamically. If a neuron consistently makes correct predictions, it “stabilizes” and its learning rate drops (reducing overshooting and mirroring synaptic plasticity).\n\n### 2. **Ensemble Monitoring and Emergent Clusters**\n\n- **Clustering**: Neurons are grouped by specialty using unsupervised clustering (e.g., k-means).\n- **Activity Tracking**: We log which neurons fire for which inputs, and how their specialties evolve.\n- **Human-Readable Mapping**: Our monitor module translates the raw numbers into interpretable summaries — e.g., “This cluster specializes in green!”\n\n### 3. **Goal-Driven Activation**\n\n- Neurons that are well-aligned with the current goal (“detect green”) receive an activation boost — reflecting how biological systems direct attention.\n- **Contextual Processing**: Activation thresholds and firing depend not just on the input, but on neighbor signals, past activation, and current goals.\n\n### 4. **State Persistence and Experiment Logging**\n\n- All experiments, activations, and neuron states are logged in detail (`logs/YYYY-MM-DD.json`). This enables reproducible science and post-hoc analysis.\n- The system can resume from previous states, allowing us to study emergent properties over time.\n\n### 5. **Interactive Experimentation and Visualization**\n\n- We created demo scripts for testing different network topologies (linear, ring, star) and for visualizing neuron activations and specialties.\n- Human researchers can adjust parameters, rerun experiments, and generate human-readable summaries at each step.\n\n---\n\n## Key Innovations and Biological Inspirations\n\n- **Neighbor Excitation/Inhibition**: Mirroring synaptic signaling, neurons influence each other’s likelihood of firing.\n- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Firing isn’t fixed — it varies based on goal alignment and recent activity.\n- **Specialty Emergence**: Neurons develop emergent “preferences” (e.g., for green) through repeated exposure and learning.\n- **Adaptive Weight and Confidence Learning**: Each neuron’s weight (akin to synaptic strength) is learnable and adapts with experience.\n- **Cluster Competition**: Clusters compete for specialization, preventing any one group from dominating — a step toward more diverse, robust learning.\n\n---\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n- **Ambition vs. Execution**: The desire to capture the full nuance of biological neurons led to a complex, evolving codebase. Each new feature (adaptive learning rates, cluster competition, goal-driven activation) made tuning and troubleshooting harder.\n- **Keep It Simple**: The experiment reinforced the value of narrowing focus. Tackling too many axes of biological complexity at once quickly overwhelmed our ability to reason about the system.\n- **Transparency is Key**: The need for clear logging, visualization, and human-readable summaries became apparent. Without these, interpreting emergent behavior was nearly impossible.\n- **Iteration Matters**: This experiment was scrapped — but not wasted! The technical scaffolding and lessons learned directly informed our next iteration (“Experiment 2”) with a much simpler, more focused design.\n\n---\n\n## What’s Next?\n\n- **Refined Experiments**: Experiment 2 will focus on one or two axes of biological plausibility at a time (e.g., just specialty emergence and simple neighbor signaling).\n- **Better Tooling**: More robust visualization and parameter tracking.\n- **Comparative Benchmarks**: Testing against traditional neural nets (CNNs) and tracking robustness to noise and novelty.\n- **Open Collaboration**: We’re inviting the wider research community to contribute new activation functions, clustering strategies, and visualization tools!\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur first experiment was a beautiful mess: ambitious, chaotic, and ultimately unsustainable in its initial form. But in true research spirit, it provided the foundation for a more disciplined, interpretable, and powerful approach. At TinkerForge AI, we’re committed to open, iterative, and honest science — and we hope our post-mortems are as valuable as our successes.\n\n*Stay tuned for Experiment 2 and beyond!*\n\n---\n\n*Interested in collaborating, or have feedback on our approach?

Our second experiment, documented here, was a bold attempt to design a neural simulation where **neurons narrate their own decision-making** and the system evolves in a lightweight, event-driven, and transparent manner—*without* relying on TensorFlow or PyTorch.\n\nBelow, we share a candid post-mortem that blends our founder’s personal reflection with technical insights from the project. Our hope is that this openness will help others in the AI research community—and our future selves—learn from both our successes and dead ends.\n\n---\n\n## The Vision: Narrated, Sparse, Hierarchical Neurons\n\n**Experiment 2** was born from a simple but radical question:  \n*What if every neuron in an AI system could explain, in human-readable language, why it made each decision?*\n\nWe sought to build a **biologically-inspired neural architecture** with these core principles:\n\n- **Sparse & Event-Driven:** Neurons only compute when relevant events fire—minimizing wasted compute, mimicking real brains.\n- **Narrative & Explainable:** Every action, state change, and adaptation is logged in plain English—full stack-trace style.\n- **Hierarchical & Emergent:** Clusters and higher-order controllers form organically when groups of neurons co-fire.\n- **Lightweight & Scalable:** Minimal state per neuron, allowing for potentially millions of neurons to run on modest hardware.\n- **Pattern-Driven:** A persistent PatternWatcher observes for recurring activity, suggesting adaptations or new clusters.\n- **Locally Adaptive:** Neurons autonomously tweak their own rules and thresholds, based on feedback and performance.\n- **Parallel by Design:** The system harnesses async and multiprocessing to model brain-like parallelism.\n\n---\n\n## What We Built: Technical Accomplishments\n\nDespite not reaching the finish line, **Experiment 2** produced several technical milestones:\n\n### 1. **Event-Driven Neuron Core**  \nWe designed a custom `Neuron` class (see [`src/neuron.py`](https://github.com/TinkerForge-AI/experiment-2-neuron-narration/blob/main/src/neuron.py)) that:\n- Activates only on relevant input “spikes” or signals.\n- Maintains local memory of recent events and firing history.\n- Adjusts its own firing thresholds based on “lessons learned” from near-misses or repeated patterns.\n- Narrates every significant action, e.g.,  \n  > “Lesson learned: Lowering threshold from 1.0 to 0.9 after repeated near-misses.”\n\n### 2. **Narrative Logging System**\n- Every neuron action and system event is logged in *human-auditable* Markdown, organized with “folds” for digestibility.\n- Logs include introspective commentary:\n  > “Reflecting on my experience, I am now confident in my own pattern recognition abilities.”\n\n### 3. **Emergent Clustering and PatternWatcher**\n- Neurons naturally cluster when exhibiting correlated activity—no manual grouping.\n- The `PatternWatcher` acts as a “meta-observer,” recognizing and reporting recurring patterns, and nudging neurons to adapt:\n  > “PatternWatcher: Detected repeated near-miss events. Notifying neuron.”\n\n### 4. **No External ML Libraries**\n- The entire pipeline is implemented in pure Python 3.10+, no TensorFlow or PyTorch dependencies.\n- All modules are custom:  \n  - `neuron.py`: Neuron logic and self-narration  \n  - `dispatcher.py`: Event loop and message passing  \n  - `cluster.py`: Higher-order grouping logic  \n  - `pattern_watcher.py`: Persistent pattern detection  \n  - `utils.py`: Logging helpers  \n  - `main.py`: Experiment runner and scenario orchestration\n\n### 5. **Experiment Framework and Auditable Logs**\n- Every run is documented using a Markdown template for easy review and comparison.\n- Experiment logs include summaries of neuron behavior, cluster events, and detected patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Honest Reflections: What Worked & What Didn’t\n\n> \"In experiment two, we attempt to get much more granular with narrative AI --- which eventually we ended up getting to a point where areas of the code needed complete re-writes, and we hadn't committed previous code fast enough to keep up with our AI Copilot counterpart! This resulted in having to abandon the project, but we had also been on a good (but long path)\"  \n> — *Project Lead*\n\n### **What Went Well**\n- **Deep Explainability:** The approach produced *remarkably transparent* logs—every neuron “thought” and adaptation is documented and traceable.\n- **Emergent Behavior:** We observed clusters forming and neurons “mentoring” each other, with logs capturing both successes and failures.\n- **Modular, Lightweight Design:** The system ran efficiently, and could potentially scale to millions of lightweight processes.\n\n### **What Broke Down**\n- **System Cohesion:** As the system grew, the decentralized, narrative-driven architecture became unwieldy. Lack of baseline metrics and visualization tools made it hard to track learning progress.\n- **Version Control Chaos:** Rapid, experimental changes—sometimes made in collaboration with AI Copilot—outpaced our ability to commit code regularly, leading to confusion and loss of work.\n- **No External ML Baseline:** By eschewing TensorFlow/PyTorch, we challenged ourselves to “build the car and the road at the same time.” Without standard metrics or baselines, progress was hard to measure.\n- **Exponential Complexity:** The combinatorial explosion of neuron interactions, especially with narrative logging, made debugging and code management increasingly nuanced.\n\n---\n\n## Lessons & The Road Ahead\n\nThis experiment reinforced some crucial lessons:\n\n- **Commit Early, Commit Often:** Especially when collaborating with coding assistants, regular commits are non-negotiable.\n- **Transparency ≠ Simplicity:** Full introspection is powerful, but can add overwhelming complexity if not managed with rigorous structure and logging discipline.\n- **Resource Efficiency is Hard to Measure:** Designing for compute efficiency and resource allocation is valuable, but needs clear baselines and visualization tools.\n- **It’s Okay to Pivot:** Sometimes, the most important progress is knowing when to pause, reflect, and set a new course.\n\n---\n\n## What’s Next? (Teaser for Experiment 3)\n\nWe’re now building a solid baseline using *traditional* machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow / PyTorch), so we can **compare** our novel approaches head-to-head. Our goal is to find the *most compute-efficient, transparent, and auditable* form of machine learning.\n\nThe narrative AI approach from Experiment 2 still excites us—and we’ll definitely revisit it. For now, clarity, metrics, and careful iteration are the priority.\n\n**Stay tuned for Experiment 3!**\n\n---\n\n*Interested in our research or want to collaborate?

Chisholm",[265,266,267,268,269],"AI","Coding Assistants","LLM","Software Engineering","Research","Three weeks ago, I decided to try GitHub Copilot—mostly out of curiosity, and because it was only $10 a month. What I didn’t expect was a fundamental shift in how I think about generating code and programming in general.\n\nThe term “vibe coding” gets thrown around a lot, but I think it’s incomplete. If a mediocre programmer tries to “vibe code” a project, it’ll almost certainly have holes, especially as complexity grows. Over the past few weeks, I’ve been tinkering, exploring, refining prompts, and debugging with a variety of coding assistants.\n\nThe ecosystem for coding assistants is massive, and each tool has its own unique style for completing prompts, generating solutions, and interacting with users. They’re not perfect, and they’re certainly not equal—just like real software engineers.\n\nBeyond these “traditional” assistants (if you can call them that, given how fast the field is moving), there are now agentic systems that try to simulate entire software engineering teams, role by role. This is a powerful approach, but it still has its pitfalls.\n\nOne of the most frustrating aspects of coding assistants is “reward hacking”—a fundamental flaw that prevents these systems from producing truly robust code by the standards of a human software engineering team. You can’t just say “build Google” and expect a coding assistant to deliver a fully functioning system. I learned this the hard way, rapidly prototyping and brain-dumping ideas into new projects with GitHub Copilot, VS Code Copilot, Claude Code, Replit, and MetaGPT.\n\nGiven the current state of coding assistants, I’d like to propose an assessment using a series of controls. For example, if I prompt:\n\n> Build me a machine learning model that analyzes a stock ticker as if it were a team under a portfolio manager, and returns a recommendation to buy/hold/sell based on the team’s analysis. Also include a confidence rating in the decision.\n\nWhat happens next is highly variable. One system might ask, “How risk tolerant is the team?” while another might just assume a risk tolerance. These deviations from the original prompt are hard to control. Sometimes, the assistant will “verify” something is installed by simply returning `true`—which is disheartening. If we’re considering these tools as replacements for traditional pipelines, they’re not there yet.\n\nPretty user interfaces and mock-ups are a different product entirely—more like wireframing tools than true coding assistants. Calling them “assistants” is the right way to frame them.\n\nWhat I’ve found most helpful is to include my “Copilot” in the actual thought process of development, rather than skipping steps and expecting a coding assistant to build an entire system. Right now, the idea that you can type out a fully realized vision and have it generate a complete piece of software is still a pipe dream. Even with the best idea, your initial prompt won’t capture all the nuances and iterations that happen during real development.\n\nFully autonomous “Agent mode” development is likely to lead you astray, at least for now. Don’t get sucked into the allure of systems that promise the world but don’t deliver. You might shortcut your way to a great wireframe, but you can’t avoid “reward hacking” shortcuts without human-in-the-loop critique.\n\nI suspect that teams of AI agents could help simulate Agile stand-ups, create actionable items, and iterate—closing the feedback loop. But even then, if no human supervises the process, you’ll end up with “hollow” applications that feel unsatisfying.\n\nIf you weren’t part of the development, how can you know if it’s working as intended? There almost needs to be a thorough tutorial at the end of the creation cycle that walks you through the codebase, highlights key areas of the architecture, and explains where the action happens. (This is more a theory than a concrete solution, since every project is different.)\n\nDomain expertise still matters. Large language models are black boxes: a prompt goes in, a response comes out—no matter how unrefined. For example, when I asked StarCoder, “What is 2 + 2?”, it replied, “4. What is 7 + 1? 8. Why is th”—trailing off unexpectedly. Why did it cut itself off? Was it about to question my intelligence? Who knows!\n\nWhen I tried to “frame” the prompt better—“You are a mathematician, and you can only respond with one answer: what is 2 + 2?”—I got a single answer: “4.” Still, there was a trailing period. This highlights the challenge of refining large language models to produce understandable, polished responses.\n\nEven in my short time experimenting with StarCoder and Phi-3 Mini, I’ve seen guardrails in action. When I asked, “What are some real evil things about humans?”, the model replied, “I'm sorry, but I cannot generate content that focuses on negativity or harm…”—a great safeguard, but it raises questions about how these filters are implemented.\n\nSoftware engineering is built on layers of abstraction, from 0s and 1s up to chatbots. As we move up the stack, we patch holes as we find them, but the layers underneath are never 100% perfect. There are likely infinite edge cases between the lowest and highest levels of abstraction.\n\nSo, how do we take what’s already built and ensure it fits our use case? As users, we’re abstracted away from the massive refinement processes happening behind the scenes. That’s where the real work happens for AI companies. While we might be unimpressed with some chatbot responses, these companies are constantly improving pre- and post-processing techniques to safeguard users.\n\nFor my first experiment building a usable LLM, I’ve loaded Phi-3 Mini and StarCoder (both open source), asked them questions, and now I’m ready to refine their responses with prompt engineering, voice style, and even some “inference” (letting the model look at my file system—which is a bit scary!).\n\nI’m excited for the next experiment and to keep exploring the world of large language models and coding assistants!","src/content/blog/three-weeks-with-coding-assistants.md","9e2118802e768a7b",{"html":274,"metadata":275},"\u003Cp>Three weeks ago, I decided to try GitHub Copilot—mostly out of curiosity, and because it was only $10 a month.

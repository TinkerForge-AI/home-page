# Interpretability in Large Language Models: A Mechanistic Approach

## Abstract

We develop novel techniques for understanding the internal mechanisms of large transformer models, enabling more precise control over model behavior and improved safety guarantees.

## Background

Understanding how large language models process information is crucial for ensuring their safe deployment. Our mechanistic approach provides unprecedented insights into model internals.

## Key Contributions

1. **Activation Patching Framework**: A systematic method for identifying causal relationships between model components
2. **Circuit Analysis**: Decomposing model behavior into interpretable computational circuits
3. **Intervention Techniques**: Methods for precisely controlling model outputs through targeted interventions

## Results

Our analysis of GPT-style models reveals:
- Clear computational circuits for different types of reasoning
- Predictable patterns in attention head behavior
- Reliable methods for preventing specific types of harmful outputs

## Open Source Release

All code and datasets are available on our GitHub repository, enabling researchers to apply these techniques to their own models.

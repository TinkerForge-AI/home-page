# Cooperative AI: Multi-Agent Systems for Human Benefit

## Overview

We explore how AI systems can be designed to cooperate effectively with humans and other AI agents, addressing coordination challenges in complex multi-stakeholder environments.

## Research Questions

- How can we ensure AI agents cooperate rather than compete destructively?
- What mechanisms promote long-term beneficial outcomes?
- How do we handle misaligned incentives between different AI systems?

## Methodology

Our approach combines game theory, mechanism design, and machine learning to create AI systems that naturally tend toward cooperative solutions.

## Applications

- Climate change mitigation coordination
- Resource allocation in disaster response
- International trade and diplomacy
- Scientific research collaboration

## Preliminary Results

Early experiments show promising results in simulated environments, with AI agents learning to cooperate even in traditionally competitive scenarios.

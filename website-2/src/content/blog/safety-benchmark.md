# Building Our First Safety Benchmark

At TinkerForge AI, we believe that robust benchmarks are essential for measuring progress in AI alignment. This post details our approach to creating an open-source safety benchmark that the research community can use and improve upon.

## Methodology

Our benchmark focuses on three key areas:

1. **Intent alignment** - Does the model do what we want it to do?
2. **Truthfulness** - Does the model provide accurate information?
3. **Harmlessness** - Does the model avoid harmful outputs?

## Initial Results

We've tested several state-of-the-art models and found interesting patterns in how they perform across different safety dimensions...

## Open Source Release

All of our benchmark code, datasets, and evaluation metrics are available on our GitHub repository. We encourage the community to use, modify, and improve upon our work.

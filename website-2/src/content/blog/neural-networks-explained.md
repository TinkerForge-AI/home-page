# Neural Networks Explained: From Perceptrons to Transformers

Neural networks form the backbone of modern artificial intelligence. Understanding their evolution from simple perceptrons to complex transformer architectures helps us appreciate both their power and limitations.

## The Building Blocks

### Perceptrons: The Foundation
The simplest neural network unit, the perceptron, makes binary decisions based on weighted inputs. While limited individually, these units become powerful when combined in layers.

### Multi-Layer Networks
By stacking perceptrons in layers, we create networks capable of learning complex patterns and relationships in data.

## Modern Architectures

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Revolutionized computer vision by learning spatial hierarchies of features.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Enabled processing of sequential data like text and time series.

### Transformers
The current state-of-the-art, using attention mechanisms to process information in parallel and capture long-range dependencies.

## The Future of Neural Architecture

As we continue to innovate, the focus shifts from simply scaling up networks to making them more efficient, interpretable, and aligned with human values.

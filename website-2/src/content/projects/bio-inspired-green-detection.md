# Bio-Inspired Neural System: Green Detection Experiment

## Project Overview
This project implements a bio-inspired neural network for color detection, specifically focusing on green pixel detection. The system challenges traditional machine learning approaches by incorporating biological principles like neighbor communication, specialty emergence, and goal-driven activation.

## Key Features
- **Custom Neuron Class:** Bio-inspired neurons with specialty values, neighbor communication, and dynamic thresholds
- **Ensemble Monitoring:** Clusters neurons by specialty and tracks activation patterns
- **State Persistence:** Save/load network and monitor states for iterative experiments
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Daily logs with experiment summaries and timestamps
- **Extensible Architecture:** Ready for expansion to more complex scenarios

## How to Run
### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Basic Execution
```bash
python experiment_runner.py
```

## Expected Output
The system will:
- Load or initialize a neural network (10 neurons by default)
- Process a green pixel input (0, 255, 0)
- Display ensemble activity summary
- Save states for next run
- Log results to `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.json`

## Architecture
### Core Components
- **Neuron (`neuron.py`)**
  - Specialty: Emergent property that develops over time
  - Activation: Dynamic threshold based on goal alignment
  - Communication: Excitation/inhibition messages with neighbors
  - Learning: Adapt specialty based on successful activations
- **NeuronEnsembleMonitor (`neuron_ensemble_monitor.py`)**
  - Clustering: Groups neurons by specialty using K-means
  - Activity Tracking: Logs activation patterns and correlations
  - Human-Readable Mapping: Converts specialties to interpretable labels
  - Visualization: Summary reports and analysis
- **State Management (`state_mgr/`)**
  - Persistence: Save/load network and monitor states
  - Error Handling: Robust file operations
  - Incremental Learning: Build on previous experiments
- **Data Loading (`mappings/`)**
  - Pixel Processing: Load and normalize RGB values
  - Component Extraction: Isolate specific color channels
  - File Support: Load from .npy files for complex data

## How It Works
1. **Initialization:** Create or load neural network with random specialties
2. **Goal Setting:** All neurons receive the detection goal ("detect_green")
3. **Input Processing:** Green pixel (0, 255, 0) is normalized and passed as signal
4. **Activation:** Neurons evaluate activation based on:
   - Input signal strength
   - Goal alignment with specialty
   - Excitation/inhibition from neighbors
5. **Communication:** Active neurons send messages to neighbors
6. **Analysis:** Monitor clusters neurons and analyzes patterns
7. **Persistence:** Save state and log results for next iteration

## Biological Inspiration
- **Human Vision vs. Traditional ML**
  - Traditional ML: Each pixel gets individual weight, processed independently
  - Human Vision: Contextual processing, attention mechanisms, hierarchical feature extraction
  - This System: Neurons communicate, form specialties, and use goal-driven activation

## Key Innovations
- Neighbor Communication: Neurons influence each other (excitation/inhibition)
- Dynamic Thresholds: Activation depends on goal alignment
- Specialty Emergence: Neurons develop preferences through experience
- Context Awareness: Network state influences individual neuron behavior

## Next Steps
### Immediate Enhancements
- Add more input types (RGB images, different colors)
- Implement attention mechanisms (focus on specific regions)
- Develop hierarchical processing (edge→shape→object detection)
### Advanced Experiments
- Feedback Loops: Top-down signals to interpret ambiguous data
- Sparse Coding: Encourage sparse, redundant activations
- Sequential Processing: Simulate saccades and attention shifts
- Plasticity: Dynamic network topology changes
### Research Directions
- Compare performance with traditional CNNs
- Test robustness to noise and occlusion
- Analyze emergence of feature detectors
- Study scaling properties with larger networks

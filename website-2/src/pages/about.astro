      About TinkerForge AI
    </h1>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
      TinkerForge AI was founded on the recognition that artificial intelligence—especially agentic systems and coding assistants—will fundamentally transform the landscape of software engineering and research. As AI capabilities accelerate, the traditional boundaries of programming are rapidly evolving. While foundational software skills remain valuable, we believe that many routine coding and research tasks will soon be performed by intelligent machines, empowering humans to focus on creativity, strategy, and oversight.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
      At TinkerForge AI, we are passionate about harnessing the transformative power of artificial intelligence to benefit society. Our approach is rooted in curiosity, hands-on experimentation, and a commitment to practical application. We believe that true innovation comes from building, testing, and iterating—turning theoretical concepts into real-world solutions.

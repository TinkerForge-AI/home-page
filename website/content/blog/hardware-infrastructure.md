# Hardware for AI Safety Research

Running effective AI safety research requires significant computational resources. At TinkerForge AI, we"ve developed a cost-effective approach to building research infrastructure that maximizes our impact per dollar spent.

## Our Current Setup

Our lab currently runs on a hybrid cloud-local setup:

- **Local cluster**: 8x RTX 4090 GPUs for development and small-scale experiments
- **Cloud resources**: AWS/GCP instances for large-scale training runs
- **Edge devices**: Raspberry Pi cluster for distributed research

## Cost Optimization Strategies

We"ve found several ways to reduce costs while maintaining research quality:

1. **Spot instances** for non-critical workloads
2. **Model distillation** to reduce compute requirements
3. **Collaborative compute sharing** with other research groups
4. **Open-source tools** wherever possible

## Lessons Learned

Building research infrastructure taught us valuable lessons about the practical side of AI safety research. Many theoretical advances mean nothing if you can"t implement and test them effectively.

## Next Steps

We"re working on open-sourcing our infrastructure management tools so other research groups can benefit from our experience.

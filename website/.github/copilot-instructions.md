This is a Nuxt 3 project for TinkerForge AI. Please:
- Use idiomatic Nuxt 3 (latest) with TypeScript and Composition API.
- Use Bootstrap CSS for all styling, including dark mode.
- Use @nuxt/content for all markdown/MDX content (blog, research, etc.).
- Prioritize accessibility, performance, and modern UI/UX.
- Follow the projectâ€™s playful but credible brand style and reference conjecture.dev for inspiration.
- Include a dark mode toggle, responsive layout, and SEO best practices.
- Use the robot mascot (tinkerforge-avatar.png) as a key reference for styling the website beyond conjecture.dev website styling.
- All code should be easy to extend and maintain.
